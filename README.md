# metodes_numerics

This project is all about numerical methods to perform basic mathematical computations such us integrations and differential equation solving. 
Everything this project contains is the material I myself developed during the numerical methods course on Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Physics degree.
It contains 3 folders, each of one contains: 
1. The c++ code
2. The .exe file resulting from the code 
3. The pdf explaining in detail the results obtained and the code
